      <h4>eQTL Practical</h4>
      <h4>Introduction</h4>
      <p>An <b>eQTL</b> or <b>expression Quantitative Trait Loci</b> analysis is a statistical analysis through which the association of genomic
      DNA sequence variants and gene expression levels can be explored. An eQTL is therefore considered a locus that explains a fraction
      of the gene expression variance found in a phenotype through direct association tests between genetic markers and
      gene expression levels (Nika & Dermitzakis, 2013).</p>
      <p>In the picture below a typical eQTL analysis is represented. Different SNPs within a 1Mb window on a determined genomic
        location (represented as blue lines) are tested with the expression levels of a given gene in different samples (harbouring
        and not harbouring the SNPs).</p>
        <div class="text-center"><img src="img/eqtl_1.png" class="img-fluid"></div>
        <p></p>
      <p>In the diagram below we can see ploted the expression levels of the samples with the different SNPs and the frequency of
        appearance of these SNPs. Therefore, both polymorphisms (AG and AA alleles) will be associated with the underexpression
        of the gene studied compared to the reference allele (GG). Thereby, these SNPs could be considered as eQTLs.</p>
        <div class="text-center"><img src="img/eqtl_2.png" class="img-fluid"></div>
        <p></p>
        The eQTLs can be considered as <i>cis</i>-eQTLs or <i>trans</i>-eQTLs depending on the physical distance from the
        gene they regulate. The <i>cis</i>-eQTLs are in the adjacent regions of the gene they regulate while <i>trans</i>-eQTLs
        can be located in a distant genomic region.</p>
        <div class="text-center"><img src="img/eqtl_3.jpg" class="img-fluid"></div>

          <h4>Exercise 1: eQTL linked with SNPs</h4>
          <p>To perform an <b>expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL)</b> study linked with SNPs we are going to need two
          datasets: one with the SNPs we are going to test and the other one with the normalised expression for each gene in
          each sample. We are going to try to associate SNPs with differential expression, and, to do so, a statistical
          analysis will be carried out. In this case, we will perform a linear regression. But there are other statistical
          tests that can be run to study associations, such as ANOVA or Wilcoxon rank-sum test.</p>
          <p><b>Preparing the data</b></p>
          <p>All the materials necessary for this exercise are located in the <i>eqtl</i> directory. You will find there a table
          with all the SNPs present in the genomic interval 2420631:2920631 (Rv2159c-Rv2590) of <i>M. tuberculosis</i>, and another table with
          the normalised expression data of the corresponding genes located in that genomic region. We are going to use the
          same 6 samples previously used for the differential expression analysis in the transcriptomics session, plus 9
          additional lineage 1 and lineage 4 samples we have added to the dataset in order to increase the power of the
          statistical analysis. In total we will be analysing 15 strains, 7 from lineage 1 and 8 from lineage 4.</p>
          <p>We can take a look at the tables in the terminal. Just go to the directory and with the "less" command you can
            view the tables. From the home directory, type:</p>
          <pre><code>cd ~/data/eqtl
less snps_eqtl_table.txt</pre></code>
          <p>To exit the view of the tables just type "q".</p>

          <p>In the SNPs table, each row represents one SNP across all the samples (columns). The first column indicates the genomic position of the SNP.
            The second and third ones refer to the reference and alternative nucleotide. The last one indicates whether the SNP falls within a gene (i.e. Rv2159c)
            or an intergenic region (-). The number 1 in the sample columns represents the presence of the SNP and the number 0 the absence.</p>
          <p>The expression table shows the normalised expression levels of each sample (columns) for each gene (rows).</p>

          <p>You should see similar tables to the ones showed above but with the 15 samples.</p>
          <p><b>Running a <i>cis</i>-eQTL analysis</b></p>
            <p>We are going to run the analysis in R. So, first, let's open R in the terminal, just typing:</p>
              <pre><code>R</pre></code>
            <p>And then we will
            load the packages we will need for the analysis. We will use a package called <b>MatrixEQTL</b>
            for the analysis and a package called <b>ggplot2</b> for plotting some results.</p>
          <pre><code>library(MatrixEQTL)
library(ggplot2)</pre></code>
            <p>Firstly, we are going to set up the directories where we have the tables we are going to use. These are going
              to be the same we just saw above but formatted for using with the R package. The folder where you can find
              them is called "tables", which is in the eqtl directory. Now you should type:</p>
            <pre><code>base.dir = "/home/user/data/eqtl/tables/"
snp_file_name = paste(base.dir, "snps_table.txt", sep="")
expression_file_name = paste(base.dir, "expression_table.txt", sep="")
output_file_name = "/home/user/data/eqtl/results_eqtl.txt"
output_file_name.cis = "/home/user/data/eqtl/results_eqtl_cis.txt"
</pre></code>
          <p>Now we can load the tables for the analysis. We will use the following script:</p>
          <pre><code>expr = read.table(expression_file_name, sep="\t", header=T, row.names=1)
snp = read.table(snp_file_name, sep="\t", header=T, row.names=1)</pre></code>
          <p>And to see the first 6 rows of the tables we just need to type:</p>
          <pre><code>head(expr)</pre></code>
          <p>Or:</p>
          <pre><code>head(snp)</pre></code>
          <p>You should get something like this:</p>
          <div class="alert alert-info" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><samp>> head(expr)

          <p>We already have the tables ready so now we need to set up the parameters for the analysis.<p>
          <p>We are going to run a <i>cis</i>-eQTL analysis, which means we are going to test those SNPs that are located
            within a distance up to 200 bp from the beginning and end of each gene.</p>
          <p>The first step is to establish the threshold p-value. The program runs at the same time a trans and a cis
            eQTL analysis. As we are only interested now in a cis study, we will establish the threshold for the
            trans p-value in 0, and for the cis p-value in 1 (this means that the output file will contain all the
            associations up to a p-value of 1).</p>
          <pre><code>pvOutputThreshold_cis = 1
pvOutputThreshold_tra = 0</pre></code>
          <p>Now we are going to select the statistical model we want to use. In this case we will use linear regression:</p>
          <pre><code>useModel = modelLINEAR</pre></code>
          <p>The last thing is to load two more tables: one with the positions of the SNPs and other with the positions of the
            genes, which we will call <i>snpspos</i> and <i>genepos</i>. These two tables are in the directory 'tables', so to
          load them in our workspace we just need to type:</p>
          <pre><code>snpspos <- read.table(paste(base.dir, "snpspos.txt", sep=""), sep="\t", header=T)
genepos <- read.table(paste(base.dir, "genepos.txt", sep=""), sep="\t", header=T)
</pre></code>
          <p>We can take a look at the tables typing:</p>
          <pre><code>head(snpspos)
head(genepos)</pre></code>
          <p>The last thing to do is to set up a few more parameters, we are not going to go into too much details for the purpose
            of this practical. Basically they prepare the matrix used for running the analysis
            and store our analysis and the results. To set this up, just copy the following script:</p>
          <pre><code>errorCovariance = numeric()
snp = SlicedData$new()
snp$fileDelimiter = "\t"
snp$fileOmitCharacters = "NA"
snp$fileSkipRows = 1
snp$fileSkipColumns = 1
snp$fileSliceSize = 2000
snp$LoadFile(snp_file_name)
gene = SlicedData$new()
gene$fileDelimiter = "\t"
gene$fileOmitCharacters = "NA"
gene$fileSkipRows = 1
gene$fileSkipColumns = 1
gene$fileSliceSize = 2000
gene$LoadFile(expression_file_name)
cvrt = SlicedData$new()
</pre></code>
            <p>And finally, we will run the analysis:</p>
            <pre><code>me = Matrix_eQTL_main(
	snps = snp,
	gene = gene,
	cvrt = cvrt,
	output_file_name = output_file_name,
	pvOutputThreshold = pvOutputThreshold_tra,
	useModel = useModel,
	errorCovariance = errorCovariance,
	verbose = TRUE,
	output_file_name.cis = output_file_name.cis,
	pvOutputThreshold.cis = 1,
	snpspos = snpspos,
	genepos = genepos,
	cisDist = 200,
	pvalue.hist = TRUE,

            <div class="alert alert-warning">With how many SNPs is it associated the variable expression of Rv2162c?</div>
            <p>To summarise, we ran a statistical analysis in order to see whether the SNPs present in our samples are associated
              with differential gene expression. We therefore got a table where we can see the SNP (its position, in <i>snps</i> column)
              associated with the differential expression of the gene (<i>gene</i> column). A high p-value association is
              established when a determined SNP is present in all the samples that have a determined gene under- or over-expressed.</p>
            <p>However, not all the associations found will be real. <i>cis</i>-eQTLs are more likely to be located within the
              promoter region of a gene, which is the upstream region where the transcription starts. For instance, a SNP in this
              promoter region might change the recognition patterns for transcriptional regulators and therefore alter gene expression.</p>
            <p><b>Further exploring the results</b></p>
            <p>We will now check one of the resulting genes in the analysis to corroborate if it is a real eQTL association.
              We are going to take the first gene, Rv2162c. This gene has been associated with 2 SNPs. Let's take a look at the 2 SNPs.
              To do it, we will load again the SNPs table and look at the rows corresponding to those 2 SNPs:</p>
            <pre><code>snps_table <- read.table("/home/user/data/eqtl/snps_eqtl_table.txt", sep="\t", header=T)

            <div class="alert alert-warning">Are all of them from the same lineage? Which one?</div>
            <div class="alert alert-warning">Are these SNPs located within the coding region or intergenic regions?</div>
            <p>We can see that all the lineage 1 samples harbour the two SNPs. One of them is located in an intergenic region, whilst
              the other is within the coding region of Rv2162c. As we mentioned before, it is more likely that a SNP present in an
              upstream or promoter region will affect transcription.</p>
            <p>If we go to the website <a href="https://mycobrowser.epfl.ch" target="_blank">https://mycobrowser.epfl.ch</a> we will find a genomic database for different species of <i>Mycobacterium</i>.
              We are going to look for our gene of interest: write Rv2162c in the top right white box and select search.</p>

            <p>We can see the Rv2162c gene (or PE_PGRS38) represented in purple in the Mycobrowser.</p>
            <div class="alert alert-warning">Is the SNP (A2424864G) in the downstream or upstream region?</div>
            <p>The SNP (A2424864G) is located in the promoter region of the Rv2162c, therefore it is a good candiate for
              being an eQTL. As the association showed a high p-value, we can expect that in all the samples carrying the SNP (in this
              case the lineage 1 samples) the Rv2162c gene would be under- or over-expressed. Looking at the expression
              table we could see this difference in expression, but a more visual way to do it is through a boxplot.</p>
            <p>To plot it we need to load a table with the expression of the Rv2162c:</p>
            <pre><code>rv2162 <- read.table("/home/user/data/eqtl/rv2162c.txt", sep="\t", header=T)
rv2162</pre></code>
            <div class="alert alert-info" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><samp>        expg    gene lineage
L1_1  4.7906 Rv2162c       1

L1_3  5.1631 Rv2162c       1
L1_4  5.4924 Rv2162c       1
L4_5  8.4655 Rv2162c       4
L4_6  9.7019 Rv2162c       4
L1_7  5.1945 Rv2162c       1
L1_8  5.6268 Rv2162c       1
L4_9  9.0890 Rv2162c       4
L1_10 5.1375 Rv2162c       1
L1_11 4.8047 Rv2162c       1
L4_12 8.6629 Rv2162c       4

L4_14 8.7615 Rv2162c       4
L4_15 9.4024 Rv2162c       4
</div>
            <p>And now let's do the plot copying the following script:</p>
            <pre><code>rv2162$lineage <- as.factor(rv2162$lineage)
bp <- ggplot(rv2162, aes(x=gene, y=expg, fill=lineage)) +
geom_boxplot() + geom_point(position=position_jitterdodge())
show(bp)</pre></code>
            <p>You should get a boxplot like this, where the y axis represents the normalised expression data and the
              two boxplots are representing the lineage 1 and lineage 4 samples respectively:</p>
            <div class="text-center"><img src="img/eqtl_7.png" class="img-fluid"></div>
<p></p>
            <div class="alert alert-warning">Is Rv2162c differentially expressed between lineage 1 and 4 according
              to the boxplot?</div>
            <div class="alert alert-warning">In which lineage is it less expressed?</div>
            <div class="alert alert-warning">Can you think about any possible explanation for the underexpression in
              the lineage 1 samples carrying the SNP?</div>

          <h4>Further exploration</h4>
            <p><b><i>trans</i>-eQTL analysis</b></p>
            <p>We have carried out a <i>cis</i>-eQTL analysis, which means that we have only looked at those SNPs close
              to the genes differentially expressed. However, as we mentioned before, there are also <i>trans</i>-eQTLs.
              These <i>trans</i>-eQTLs would be, for instance, SNPs located in transcriptional regulators that might
              alter their function. Hence, transcription of those genes regulated by the altered transcriptional factors
              could be affected.</p>
            <p><b>eQTL linked with methylation</b></p>
            <p>Methylation is also a mechanism of gene expression control (Casadesus & Low., 2006) and therefore another
            approach we can take with eQTL analysis is to associate methylation with gene expression. Given the position of
            the motifs and methylated bases we could treat them as if they were SNPs and perform the same analysis.</p>
