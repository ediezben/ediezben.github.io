    <h4>Introduction</h4>
    <p>
        Almost all bioinformatic software is written for command line. This means they are intended to be used by
        typing in commands and don't have a graphical user interface (GUI). There are many reasons for this, but one
        of the most important ones is that command line programs are very easy to automate. To get from raw sequences
        to final results often requires many steps. Imagine processing thousands of isolates: this would potentially
        involve hundreds of hours and even more mouse clicks if performed with a GUI. Using a command line tool, a
        workflow can be defined by chaining a series of commands together and can be rapidly applied to thousands
        of isolates without much effort.
    </p>
    <p>
        Over the duration of this course you will be learning the skills required to independently undertake
        bioinformatic projects. By the end of this course you should be comfortable to go all the way from raw data to biological
        insights.
    </p>
    <p>
        In order to learn how to use bioinformatic programs we must first become comfortable with how to use the terminal.
        This may be daunting if you have never used a command line environment before, but hopefully by the end of this
        practical session you should have a basic understanding which will be reinforced over the next few sessions.
    </p>
    <p>
        Let's start by opening a terminal by clicking on the icon on the sidebar.
        Your screen should now look like the one below:
    </p>
    <img src="img/omics_intro_1.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="Responsive image">
    <p>
        The terminal is very similar to the file explorer in other operating systems. It allows you to see files and
        interact with them. The only difference is that we have to do this by typing a command into the terminal window.
        To demonstrate this, let's open up Linux's file explorer by clicking on the icon in the side-bar on the left-hand
        side of the screen. When you open the file explorer it will go to your home folder and show you all the sub-folders
        and files present. The home folder is simply the root folder which contains all your files and folders.
    </p>
    <p>
        You can see a number of sub-folders and files present in the file explorer. Let's see if we can find them in the
        terminal. To do this, we have to type <kbd>ls</kbd> into the terminal and hit enter. You should now see a
        screen similar to the one below. Now you can see the same files and folders in the terminal.
    </p>
    <img src="img/omics_intro_2.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="Responsive image">
    <p>
        In the file explorer double click on the <strong>data</strong> folder. You will see several new folders which
        hold the data for the proceeding practicals. Let's try find them using the terminal!
    </p>
    <p>
        When we double clicked on the <strong>data</strong> folder we effectively moved from the home folder to the
        data folder. We will have to do the same using the terminal. To do this, type in <kbd>cd data</kbd> and hit enter.
        Now try using <kbd>ls</kbd> again to produce the same list of folders that you see in the file explorer.
    </p>
    <div class="alert alert-primary" role="alert">
        Note: Folders are often referred to as <strong>directories</strong> in Linux. We will use
        <strong>directory</strong> from now on, but the two words are synonymous.
    </div>
    <img src="img/omics_intro_3.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="Responsive image">
    <p>
        You will notice that text in front of the <kbd>$</kbd> sign changed when you moved from
        <strong>home</strong> to <strong>data</strong>. You should see something similar to what is shown below:
    </p>
    <div class="alert alert-info" role="alert">
        <samp> <font color="#88e42b">user@user-VirtualBox</font>:<font color="#739fcc">~/data</font>$ </samp>
    </div>
    <p>
        The blue text shows the location where the terminal is currently. In this case we are in <kbd>~/data</kbd>.
        Another name for this is the current directory. The <kbd>~</kbd> character is a special character which
        symbolises your home directory. So, we can interpret this as <i>"We are currently in the data directory which
        is in the home directory"</i>
    </p>
    <div class="alert alert-warning" role="alert">
        Another way of finding the current location of the terminal is by using <kbd>pwd</kbd> which stands for <i>print working
            directory</i>. Try using this command. Does it produce a similar output to what we have seen above?
    </div>
    <div class="alert alert-primary" role="alert">
        We have now successfully used the terminal and the <kbd>ls</kbd>, <kbd>cd</kbd> and <kbd>pwd</kbd> commands.
        It is as simple as that! Some commands can be used by themselves such as <kbd>ls</kbd>, however others such
        as <kbd>cd</kbd> need additional information called <strong>arguments</strong> to do something useful. In
        the example above, we need to tell <kbd>cd</kbd> that we wanted to go to the data directory, so we typed <kbd>data</kbd>
         after <kbd>cd</kbd> separated by a space. While <kbd>cd</kbd> only took one argument, some programs take many more.
         You will see examples of this in a bit.<br><br>

        Now that you have mastered using the terminal you can close the file explorer, this is the last time we will
        use it. We must face the long dark of the terminal!
    </div>
    <hr>
    <h4>Useful commands/programs</h4>
    <p>
        Now that we are familiar with the terminal let's dive in and take a look at a couple of programs that we
        will be using.
    </p>
    <hr>
    <h5>head</h5>
    <p>
        Change to the tb directory and have a look at the files. Hopefully you will be able to see the
        <strong>tb.fasta</strong> file. The file is just a very large text file which stores the sequence data of the
        <i>M. tuberculosis</i> reference genome. We can use <kbd>head</kbd> to take a look at the first few lines
        of a file. Let's try it:
    </p>
    <pre><code>cd tb
ls
head tb.fasta</code></pre>
    <p>
        Hopefully you will see something like this:
    </p>
    <div class="alert alert-info" role="alert">
        <samp>>Chromosome

CGCCGCCGCCTTGGCGATCGCAGAAGCACCCGCCCGCGCTTACAACCCCCTGTTCATCTGGGGCGAGTCC</samp>
    </div>
    <p>
        We can see that by default <kbd>head</kbd> prints out the first 10 lines. We can modify this number by
        providing an additional parameter.
    </p>
    <pre><code>head -5 tb.fasta</code></pre>
    <p>
        This command it will print out the first five lines instead. Here we have used an optional parameter (the program
        will still function properly without it). Optional parameters are usually given by providing two values,
        in this case <kbd>-n</kbd> and <kbd>5</kbd>. The first value specified what parameter we want to provide
        (e.g. <kbd>-n</kbd> = number of lines) and the second value is that which the parameter must take (e.g.
        <kbd>5</kbd> will tell the command to print the first <b>five</b> lines).
    </p>
    <hr>

    <h5>less</h5>
    <p>
        Another tool that we can use to view text files is the <kbd>less</kbd> command. Let's try view the reference
        file again with this method.
    </p>
    <pre><code>less tb.fasta</code></pre>
    <p>
        This will open an interactive viewer which fills up the screen. You can move up and down the file using the
        up and down keys on the keyboard. When you are finished viewing, hit the <kbd>q</kbd> key to quit the
        viewer.
    </p>
    <hr>
    <h5>cp</h5>
    <p>
        If we need to copy a file we can use the <kbd>cp</kbd> command. We need to give two arguments: the file
        we want to copy and the filename of the copy. Let's try it:
    </p>
    <pre><code>cp tb.fasta tb_copy</code></pre>
    <div class="alert alert-primary" role="alert">
        <div>Two things to note here:</div>
        <ol>
            <li><b>Spaces are not allowed in file names!</b> Always use an underscore instead of a space.</li>
            <li>We have not given our new file an extension. Extensions are useful as they tell us something
            about how a file is formatted and what it might contain. If we come back a year later, we might have
            forgotten that tb_copy contained sequence data.</li>
        </ol>


    </div>
    <hr>
    <h5>mv</h5>
    <p>
        Let's give our file an extension. To do this we have to rename the file. The command for this is <kbd>mv</kbd>
        which stands for <i>move</i>. This command allows you to both move and rename files. Try to add an extension
        to the file by using the following code:
    </p>
    <pre><code>mv tb_copy tb_copy.fasta</code></pre>
    <p>
        <div>You can see that this command also required two parameters:</div>
        <ol>
            <li>The file we want to rename</li>
            <li>The new file name</li>
        </ol>
    </p>
    <hr>
    <h5>rm</h5>
    <p>
        We now have two files with the same content. Let's remove our copy of the reference by using the <kbd>rm</kbd>
        command:
    </p>
    <pre><code>rm tb_copy.fasta</code></pre>
    <div class="alert alert-primary" role="alert">
        <b>Be very careful with this command!</b> Once you remove a file using <kbd>rm</kbd> there is no way of
        getting it back. Always double check you are removing the right file before hitting enter.
    </div>
    <hr>
    <h4>Pipes</h4>
    <p>
        Imagine a cake factory production line. There are many steps that need to be taken to build the final
        cake (different ingredients added). Let's say we have 5 people working to make 100 cakes per day and
        each person specialises in adding a particular ingredient. We could get 100 bowls and add the flour
        to each one, then add eggs to each one and repeat this with each ingredient until we have the complete mix
        however we would be losing a lot of time as at any point there would be only one person working while the others
        wait for their turn. A more efficient way to do this by installing in a conveyor belt and having the employees
        sequentially add their ingredients to each bowl. This way everyone is working at the same time and the cakes
        will be made a lot faster.
    </p>
    <img src="img/omics_intro_4.gif" class="img-fluid" alt="Responsive image">
    <p>
        The same principals apply to bioinformatic analyses. For example, take a look at the steps required  to
        align raw data to a reference genome and storing it in a BAM file:
        <ol>
            <li>Find best location for each read</li>
            <li>Convert the output into BAM format</li>
            <li>Sort the reads by alignment position</li>
        </ol>
        We could do each step separately, however this would waste resources as only one command will be running at
        any time. Instead we can create our own conveyor belt which in Linux is called <b>piping</b>. We can do this by using
        the pipe character (<kbd>|</kbd>) to chain our commands together. Here is some simplified pseudocode:
    </p>
    <pre><code>mapping_command | sam->bam_command | sorting_command</code></pre>
    <p>
        This is the form pipes will take and we will see several examples over the next few practicals.
    </p>
    <hr>
    <h4>Troubleshooting</h4>
    <p>
        Sometimes an error may occur while trying to run a command. There may be a number of different reasons
        for this and troubleshooting is an important skill to master.
    </p>
    <p>
        <div>There are a number of ways to check if your commands have failed including:</div>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <b>Run time</b>: Some commands (such as alignment) are expected to run for at least a few
                minutes. If the command finished instantly and you do not expect it to do so then something has
                probably gone wrong.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Error messages</b>: Usually if a command has failed it will print out an error message.
                Check the last few lines of output from a program and check to see if you see any.
            </li>
        </ol>
    </p>
    <p>
        There are some errors which are are commonly made. We have listed a few below.
    </p>
    <hr>
    <h5>File or folder not present</h5>
    <p>
        These types of error may present in different ways depending on the command used. For example, let's try
        change to a directory that doesn't exist.
    </p>
    <pre><code>cd fake_directory</code></pre>
    <p>
        You should see something like this:
    </p>
    <div class="alert alert-info" role="alert">
        <samp>cd: fake_directory: No such file or directory</samp>
    </div>
    <p>
        This tells us that <kbd>cd</kbd> could not find the directory called <b>fake_directory</b>.
    </p>
    <hr>
    <h5>Missing a required argument</h5>
    <p>
        If you run a program and fail to specify a it may give an error. Alternatively, it may display the program usage
        help and quit. For example, lets run <kbd>head</kbd> without passing the number of lines to the <kbd>-n</kbd>
        flag:
    </p>
    <pre><code>head -n tb.fasta</code></pre>
    <p>
        You should see an error similar to that displayed below:
    </p>
    <div class="alert alert-info" role="alert">
        <samp>head: invalid number of lines 'tb.fasta'</samp>
    </div>
    <p>
        The error is a bit cryptic but from the <i>illegal line count</i>, we can see that whatever parameter
        we passed to <kbd>-n</kbd> (which determines how many lines are printed) is not a valid value. It turns
        out that this value always has to be a number, however since we left out that parameter it parses <b>tb.fasta</b>
        as the value and that causes the error.
    </p>
    <hr>
    <h4>R - A statistical package</h4>
    <p>
        In some parts of the practial you will be asked to open <b>R</b>. R is a free software environment for statistical
        computing and graphics. It compiles and runs on a wide variety of UNIX platforms, Windows and MacOS. We will
        be using it to run analysis and visualise results. R runs on the terminal and is started by typing <kbd>R</kbd>
        and hitting enter. Go ahead and try it now. After running R you should see something like this in the terminal:
    </p>
    <div class="alert alert-info" role="alert">
        <samp>R version 3.5.0 (2018-04-23) -- "Joy in Playing"

></samp>
    </div>
    <p>
        It migt look slightly different depending on the version installed, but once you can see the '<b>></b>'
        you are ready to type in commands. Try this for example:
    </p>
    <pre><code>1+2</code></pre>
    <p>
        This will output a value of '3'. You can store values in variables so you can access them later. Try this:
    </p>
    <pre><code>x&lt;-1+2
x+1</code></pre>
    <p>
        You should have gotten an output of '4' after executing the final line. Here we stored the outcome of
        <kbd>1+2</kbd> in <kbd>x</kbd> and then asked R to output <kbd>x+1</kbd>.
    </p>
    <p>
        We can also use R to visualise data. Try to run the following:
    </p>
    <pre><code>plot(1:10,1:10)</code></pre>
    <p>
        A plot similar to the one below should appear.
    </p>
    <img src="img/omics_intro_5.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="Responsive image">
    <p>
        We do not expect you to master R during this course, but rather to know how to run commands and understand
        what they are doing. You can exit R by typing <kbd>quit()</kbd> <br> followed by <kbd>n</kbd>.
    </p>
    <p>
        That is it for the into to linux. You are now ready to go on the practicals. Good luck!
    </p>
