      <h4>Introduction</h4>
	  <p>Improvements in DNA sequencing technology have led to new opportunities for studying organisms at
		  the genomic and transcriptomic levels . Applications include studies of genomic variation within
		  species and gene identification . In this module we will concentrate on data generated using the
		  Illumina Genome Analyzer II technology, although the techniques you will learn are applicable to
		  other technologies (e . g . 454 GS FLX and ABI SOLiD ) . A single machine can produce around 20
		  Gigabases of sequence data in a week . This is the equivalent to over 6 human genomes . The data
		  from the Illumina machine comes as relatively short stretches of 35 - 250 base pairs ( bp ) of
		  DNA - around 300 million of them . These individual sequences are called <strong>reads</strong> . The older
		  capillary sequencing technology generates longer reads of ~ 500 bp, but the approach is much slower
		  and more expensive.
	  </p>
	  <p>One of the greatest challenges of sequencing a genome is determining how to arrange
		  sequencing reads into chromosomes. This process of determining how the reads fit together by looking
		  for overlaps between them is called genome assembly. Capillary sequencing reads (~500bp) are
		  considered a good length for genome assembly. Genome assembly using sequence reads of &lt;100bp is
		   more complicated due to the high frequency of repeats longer than the read length. Assemblies for
		   bacterial genomes can comprise of at least 50 pieces (called “contigs”), whilst for Eukaryotes more
		   than 1000 pieces is common. Therefore new sequencing technologies are applied predominantly where a
		   reference genome already exists. A reference genome is a well assembled genome from the same or a
		   similar organism that is ungoing sequencing. Sequencing a genome with new technology when there is
		   an existing reference is called re-sequencing.
	   </p>
	   <p>In this practical, we will focus on mapping reads to a reference genome, and visualising the resulting
		   alignments using Tablet.
	   </p>
	   <h4>Sequencing/Mapping workflow</h4>
	   <p>The diagram below describes the workflows for genomic resequencing and RNA sequencing. We will cover the
		   in silico (computational) aspects of these workflows.
	   </p>
	   <img src="img/Mapping_1.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="Responsive image">
	   <p>When resequencing, instead of assembling the reads to produce a new genome sequence and then comparing
		   the two genome sequences, we map the new sequence data to the reference genome. We can then identify
		   Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs), insertions and deletions (indels) and Copy Number Variants
		   (CNVs) between two similar organisms.
	   </p>
	   <p>The first example we use here is a reference genome for Plasmodium falciparum (3D7 clone, size 23Mb,
		   81% AT content) (Gardener et al., 2002). This parasite is the causative agent of malaria. Malaria is
		   widespread in tropical and subtropical regions, including parts of the Americas, Asia, and Africa.
		   Each year, there are approximately 350–500 million cases of malaria, killing between one and three
		   million people, the majority of whom are young children in sub-Saharan Africa. Recently we sequenced
		   two laboratory strains, IT and DD2, using 76 bp paired end read technology. The second example is using
		   the reference genome for Mycobacterium tuberculosis (H37Rv, size 4.4Mb, GC content 65.6%) (Cole et al,
		   1998). This bacterium causes tuberculosis disease.
	   </p>
	   <p>Rather than attempt to assemble these very short reads into a whole new genome, we will map these reads
		   against the existing genome assembly of<i>P. falcipraum</i> 3D7 or<i>M. tuberculosis</i> H37Rv. Furthermore, we will
		   identify differences between the genomes of the three clones, find mutations and CNVs associated to drug
		   resistance, whilst determining how the reads fit together.
	   </p>

			   <div class="col-sm">
				   <p>Here is the general workflow of mapping:</p>
				   <p>The paired end reads (F – forward; R - reverse) are mapped against the reference. Different tools
					   can be used for that. The results can be transformed with samtools to an ordered and indexed bam
					   file. Those bam files can be read into programs like Artemis to visualize the alignments of the
					   short sequences. From the bam file it is possible to call variants. The output format is BCF or
					   VCF. VCF can be loaded easily into excel like tools.
				   </p>
				   <p>Quality control of the reads is always important, to correct for any GC content biases, possible
					   contamination and read quality.

	   <h4>File formats</h4>
	   <p>You have the <i>P. falciparum</i> 3D7 clone reference file (Pf3D7_05.fasta). This contains the assembled sequence
		   of the 3D7 genome. You also have two files of sequence reads from the IT clone (IT.Chr5_1.fastq and
		   IT.Chr5_2.fastq). Look in both the reference file and the read files.
	   </p>
	   <h5>FASTA format</h5>

		<h4>Quality Control</h4>

		<p>Prior to the analysis of these sequences, it is highly advisable to perform quality control checks and
			filtering in order to minimise artefacts in reads including base calling errors, poor quality reads or
			primer contamination. The difference in passing filtered data to downstream programs can be night-and-day
			for processes like de novo assembly or SNP calling.
		</p>
		<p>FastQC is a tool written in Java to perform quality control checks on raw sequence data. It computes
			several statistics and shows the results on summary graphs and tables. We will analyse several datasets
			in order to check whether the samples look good or, on the contrary, they require further filtering.
		</p>
		<p>Open up a new terminal window and then type: <kbd>fastqc</kbd></p>
		<p>Once the program is running, select <kbd>File > Open</kbd> to open one or more Sequence files (see below).
			Browse to <strong>~/data/tb/</strong> to choose <strong>sample1_1.fastq</strong> and click <kbd>OK</kbd>.
		</p>
		<p>FastQC supports FASTQ files (all quality encoding variants), GZip compressed FastQ and alignment files
			(SAM and BAM formats)
		</p>
		<p>Newly opened files will be immediately processed. Because of the size of FASTQ files it can take a couple
			of minutes to open them

      <p>We have used the FastQC tool to identify problems in raw sequence data. Nevertheless, bad quality issues
          in our data are not a death sentence for the experiment; it can still be useful for downstream analyses
          if we applied the right filtering before processing. In general, the problem in the sequence files is
          the degradation in quality of bases at end of the reads, leading to the need to hard clip or trim them.
      </p>
      <h4>Trimming Illumina paired-end reads using Trimmomatic</h4>
      <div class="alert alert-primary">
          The quality of the last few bases of the read can be substantially lower than the rest of the sequence
              read. In general, QC tools are unable to filter these reads out due to their overall high quality.
              Besides, it is not advisable to discard the whole read just because of few low-quality bases at the
              ends. Therefore, it is crucial to trim such bases before any further analysis. Trimmomatic
              (Lohse et al., 2012) is a fast command line tool that can be used to trim and crop Illumina data as
              well as to remove adapters (see Table below). We will be using the paired-end mode which will process
              both forward and reverse reads simultaneously maintaining the correspondence of read pairs intact.

<h4>Alignment of short reads</h4>
<div class="alert alert-primary" role="alert">
    A major step in most sequence analysis pipelines involves the alignment of reads against the reference genome, a
    requisite stage for downstream analyses. Traditional alignment software have become obsolete when dealing with
    the large amounts of short reads (millions) produced by NGS platforms and, during the last few years, software
    particularly designed to map short queries onto a long reference sequence have been produced.
</div>
<p>Current popular alignment tools are summarised in Li & Homer (2010). As shown in column 5 in the Table below, most
    of them allow gaps in alignments. Effective gapped aligners avoid calling false SNPs predicted due to the presence
    of insertions and deletions (indels). Furthermore, software including paired-end information are capable of mapping
    repeat reads with uniquely mapped mates; they also correct alignment errors that are inconsistent with the
    constraints imposed by mate pairs in terms of distance and orientation. Base quality in reads has also been
    exploited by programs like MAQ improving alignment accuracy.
</p>
<p>All aforementioned programs output both aligned and unaligned reads in Sequence Alignment/Map (SAM) format
    (H. Li et al. 2009), a standardised format widely supported by downstream bioinformatic tools (e.g. variant
    callers, alignment viewers). The development and improvement of efficient short-read alignment algorithms has
    made the fast processing of data produced by current sequencing platforms feasible which, initially, entailed
    a bottleneck in the analysis of such high-coverage sequence dataset.
</p>
<h4>Sequence alignment Exercise 1</h4>
<div class="alert alert-primary" role="alert">
    In this exercise we will be running the Burrows-Wheeler Aligner (BWA), an efficient program that aligns
    relatively short nucleotide sequences (i.e. short reads) against a long reference sequence. It implements
    two algorithms, bwa-short and BWA-SW. The former works for query sequences shorter than ~200bp with low
    error rate (&lt;3%) (e.g. reads produced by Illumina technology). It performs gapped global alignment, supports
    paired- end reads, and is one the fastest short read alignment algorithms currently available. BWA- SW is
     designed for longer sequences (e.g. 454 reads) with more errors.
</div>

     <p>In order to map our paired-end reads we will use ‘index’ and ‘mem’ commands. The ‘index’ command takes the reference genome (the database) in FASTA format as input and indexes it, which typically will take a few hours. This command only needs to be executed once for a particular reference genome</p>
     <p>To see all options for the ‘index’ command type:</p>

    <p>Most options will be set automatically according to the data we are running it on so we do not have to worry about setting them.</p>
    <p>Type the following line:<p>
    <pre><code>bwa index ~/data/tb/tb.fasta</pre></code>
    <p>Several aligning algorithms are implemented in BWA. We will be using the BWA-MEM, which is the latest and generally recommended for high-quality queries as it is faster and more accurate. To see which parameters can be tuned for the ‘mem’ command type: <kbd>bwa mem</kbd></p>
    <p>We will be using the trimmed files output (from applying trimmomatic) as input for BWA:</p>

samtools index sample1.bam
    </code></pre>
    <p>The previous commands transformed SAM files into binary format, sorted the reads by occurrence against the reference, and then indexed the bam files. At this point, we can use the ‘flagstat’ samtools command to print summary statistics from indexed bam files:</p>
    <pre><code>samtools flagstat sample1.bam</code></pre>

    <p>
        Tablet will display one alignment per window, so if more samples need to be viewed, open a new terminal and
        type <kbd>tablet</kbd> and follow the steps described earlier with another sample.
    </p>
    <p>
        Tablet loads and can display up to 25,000 bp at a time as default, delimited by the Overview window
        (1). This can be changed using the Window Size button in the Advanced tab. The blue semi-transparent
        square defines the region that is being displayed in the Read panel (2). To navigate through the chromosome
        you will need to use the bar on top by dragging it. To navigate through the 25 Kb loaded you can click and
        drag the Read panel or use the buttons on the Top Bar. Note that the red numbers in each corner of the Read
        panel will display the region currently being shown (Blue squares).
    </p>
    <p>
        Zooming into the sequence can be done using the Zoom button in the Top bar.
    </p>
    <p>
        It is possible to change the Overview display to show a Coverage plot by using the <kbd>Coverage</kbd> button under
        the <kbd>Advanced</kbd> tab.
    </p>
    <img src="img/Mapping_13.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="Responsive image">
    <p>
        For paired-end alignments, the best way is to display the paired reads is by changing the Read Packing
        option to Packed (Paired end).You are encouraged to investigate the differences on the visualization caused
        by different read packing options.
    </p>
    <p>
        The way Tablet allows you to navigate through your reads is combining different colour coding for your reads
        and showing information about individual reads (and their mate reads) when hovering with your mouse over
        them.
    </p>
    <p>
        You will find the colouring key under the Colour Schemes tab in the Top Bar. When hovering over them it
        will show an explanation of how the colour code works.
    </p>
    <img src="img/Mapping_14.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="Responsive image">
    <p>
        The most useful options you will find are the Read Type option, to discover reads where the mate pair has
        not been mapped and the Direction option to discover reads where the two mate pairs are oriented in the
        same direction. Note that as paired reads they should always map one Forward and the other Reverse. You
        can read the other options by hovering over the buttons.
    </p>
    <img src="img/Mapping_15.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="Responsive image">
    <p>
        Tablet displays individual information about the read and its mate pair when the mouse is hovered over
        them. This can help us identify interesting reads.
    </p>
    <p>
        At higher resolutions, read bases that do not match the reference are colour coded with a lighter colour
        shade than the original bases. The contrast between the reference bases and those that are different can
        be adjusted using the Variants bar in the Top Bar under the “Home”. In addition, the Variants option under
        the Colour Scheme tab can be used to show the variants and make their visualization more easy.
    </p>
    <img src="img/Mapping_16.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="Responsive image">
    <p>
        To outline a read and its paired mate, right click on it and then click Outline > Read then right click on
        it again and press Jump to > Read’s mate. This will move you to the position of the mate read and then you
        can repeat the Outline step. A black outline will appear once you do this, and it can be a good way to track
        long reads or highlight interesting reads.
    </p>
    <p>
        Another feature from Tablet is the possibility to get the read name copied to your clipboard or  the whole
information about the read (e.g. name, sequence and quality) in order to further investigate interesting reads. To
try this click on the <kbd>Copy read name to clipboard</kbd> or <kbd>Copy read data to clipboard</kbd> from this same right click menu

    <h4>Exercise: Mapping the <i>P. falciparum</i> IT reads with BWA</h4>
    <div class="alert alert-primary">
        Now we will map the IT clone reads to the 3D7 reference, again using the short reads mapping program BWA
        (Li et al, 2009).
    </div>
    <p>
        First we need to index the reference (the algorithm needs to access specific positions in the reference
        in an efficient way).
    </p>
    <pre><code>cd ~/data/malaria/
bwa index ~/data/malaria/Pf3D7_05.fasta
</code></pre>
    <p>
        Next, read files (both forward/reverse) are mapped against the reference
    </p>
    <pre><code>bwa mem ~/data/malaria/Pf3D7_05.fasta ~/data/malaria/IT.Chr5_1.fastq ~/data/malaria/IT.Chr5_2.fastq | samtools view -b - | samtools sort -o IT.Chr5.bam -</code></pre>
    <p>The details of where each IT clone read has been mapped is now stored in the file <strong>IT.Chr5.bam</strong>.
        We are going to view the mapped reads in Artemis using Artemis BAM view. Before we can proceed, however, we
        must index the BAM file to allow programs suchh as Artemis quick access to different sections of the file.
    </p>
    <pre><code>samtools index IT.Chr5.bam</code></pre>
    <p>Before we visualize the alignment of the reads in a Artemis, let us have a look at the sam/bam format.
        SAMTOOLS was developed to have a standard format to store reads. It contains information about the
        reference sequence, where a read is mapped, quality of mapping, and where it’s mate is mapped. Files
        ending with .sam, are normally plain text,  but as they might take too much space, the file is compressed
        into a bam file. All visualization tools will need the bam file. It has to be sorted (by chromosome and
        position) and indexed. Indexing enables the fast processing of alignments.
    </p>
    <p>Here is an example of a read and its mate. We need to use <kbd>samtools</kbd> to convert to SAM format and then <kbd>grep</kbd>
        to look for a specific read:
    </p>
    <pre><code>samtools view IT.Chr5.bam | grep "IL39_6014:8:61:7451:18170"</code></pre>
    <img src="img/Mapping_18.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="Responsive image">

    <h4>Viewing the mapped reads in Artemis</h4>
    <p>We will now examine the read mapping in Artemis using the BAM view feature.</p>
    <p>Open Artemis by typing <kbd>art</kbd> on your command line. Select <kbd>File</kbd> -> <kbd>Open...</kbd>
         and load <strong>Pf3D7_05.embl</strong> from
        the <strong>~/data/malaria/</strong> data directory. This contains exactly the same sequence as
        <stong>Pf3D7_05.fasta</strong>, but also has genome annotation, allowing us to visualise the gene models.
    </p>
    <p>From the Artemis File menu, select <kbd>Read BAM / CRAM /VCF</kbd>, then locate the file <strong>IT.Chr5.bam</strong>
        from <strong>~/data/malaria/</strong> directory.
    </p>
    <p>You should see the BAM window appear as in the screen shot below. We want to change the view in order to better
        see how the reads map to the genome.
    </p>

             <li><strong>Inferred Size</strong>: (click also Use log scale) displays the mate pair on the
             y-axis depending their distance. In this case, some reads map further apart compared to
             others. Could this be a deletion?
             </li>
             <li><strong>Strand Stack</strong>: displays the strand where reads are mapping. This is useful
                 for strand specific applications.

        These two windows provide information on the mapping of the reads, as it is stored in the bam file.
        Notice the <strong>Mapping quality</strong>. The maximum value for this is 60. The mapping quality
        depends on the accuracy of the sequence read and the number of mismatches with the reference. A value
        of 0 means that the read maps equally well to at least one other location and therefore is unreliably
        mapped. The flags describe the read’s mate pair mapping. Most of those values can be filtered, to do so,
        right click in the BAM track and select the <kbd>Filter Reads...</kbd> option.

    <h4>Differences in read coverage between reference and resequenced genomes</h4>
    <p>
        It is thought that a duplication in the mdr1 gene of P. falciparum is associated with drug resistance
        against the antimalarial mefloquine and that it may also modulate susceptibility to chloroquine, another
        antimalarial drug. For more information have a look in PubMed, e.g. at Borges et al. (2011)
        [PMID: 21709099] or at Mungthin et al. (2010) [PMID: 20449753]
    </p>

    <p>
        Once Artemis has started running on your screen navigate to the mdr1 gene locus using e.g. the Navigator
        (Goto –> Navigator… –> Goto Feature With Gene Name).
    </p>
    <div class="alert alert-warning" role="alert">
        What can you say about the read coverage at this locus? (you may have to zoom out to get a good look).
        So far you looked at the IT strain. What about the mdr1 locus in the Dd2 strain of the malaria parasite?
    </div>

    <p>
         The Dd2 clone is known to be chloroquine resistant. Add its mapped reads (a file already prepared before
         the course) by right-clicking on the BAMview and choosing <kbd>Add BAM/CRAM ...</kbd>. Select the file <strong>DD2.Chr5.bam</strong>
    </p>
    <img src="img/Mapping_23.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="Responsive image">
    <div class="alert alert-warning" role="alert">
        It looks like that those two clones have a copy number variation (assuming the reference was assembled correctly). Is the
        duplication the same in both clones?
    </div>
    <h4>Identifying Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms</h4>
    <p>
        Let us have a look at SNPs now. To do so, zoom in on the mdr1 gene and make sure you are in <strong>Strand Stack
        view</strong> and have Show SNP marks selected. As mentioned before, in addition to true SNPs some differences
        between the reference sequence and the mapped reads are due to sequencing errors. On average, 1 in every
        100 bases in the reads is expected to be incorrect. In particular, some sequencing errors may be due to
        a systematic problem as illustrated below.
    </p>
    <p>
        Red marks appear on the stacked reads highlighting every base in a read which does not match to the reference. If
        you zoom in you can distinguish real SNPs as vertical red lines, while the random sequencing errors are more
        disperse.
    </p>
    <img src="img/Mapping_24.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="Responsive image">

    <div class="alert alert-warning" role="alert">
        When you zoom in on position 958145 as far as you can go, you can see a SNP: here, both strain IT and Dd2
        have a thymine where the reference (3D7) has an adenine.
        What is the consequence of this SNP? Can we tell what effect it will have for the clones? Is this the mutation
        N86Y (or also simply referred to as Y86) that may modulate the degree of resistance to chloroquine? (See e.g. Mula et al. (2011) [PMID: 21810256])
    </div>
    <img src="img/Mapping_25.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="Responsive image">
    <p>
        To answer the just posed, right-click on the gene annotation of the mdr1 gene and then choose View – Amino
        Acids Of Selection: here you can see which amino acids are normally coded for around amino acid position
        86. Note also that AAT codes for Asn (N) and TAT codes for Tyr (Y).

    </p>
    <div class="alert alert-warning" role="alert">
        Now consider the neighbouring position 958146. What could this be? Is it from IT or Dd2? To answer this
        question, close the window and display the reads of only one or the other parasite strain in each window,
        as demonstrated below.

        <h4>Important aspects of the mapping procedure</h4>

        <p>
            <strong>Non-unique/repeat regions</strong><br>
            A sequence read may map equally well to multiple locations in the reference genome. In such cases it is
            unclear where the read should be placed. Different mapping algorithms have alternative strategies for this
            problem. Maq will randomly report only one of the mapping locations and give the read a score of 0.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>GC content</strong><br>
            Some organisms have genomes with extreme GC content. The Plasmodium genome, for instance, is 19% GC,
            meaning 81% of bases are A or T. The result of this is that reads are more likely to map by chance to
            multiple locations in the genome, when compared to a genome with neutral GC content (e.g. 40-60% GC).
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Insert size</strong><br>
            When mapping paired reads, the mapping algorithm (e.g. Maq) takes the expected insert (e.g. sequenced
            DNA fragment) size into account. If the fragments are expected to be, on average 400bp and the sequence
            reads are 150bp, then the paired reads should be ~100bp apart. If the paired reads are significantly
            further apart then we can say that the reads do not map reliably and discard them. This information can
            assist with improving the reliability of mapping.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Tips</strong><br>
            It is always a good idea to try different programs for any particular problem in computational biology.
            If they all produce the same answer you can be more certain it is correct. Alternative short read mappers
            include SOAP (Li et al., 2008b), Ssaha (Ning et al., 2001), MAQ (Li et al., 2008), Bowtie(2)
            (Langmead et al, 2009, 2012) and SMALT. As seen, TopHat (Trapnell et al., 2009) is particularly useful for
            RNAseq mapping as it supports spliced mapping. New tools for mapping sequence reads are continually being
            developed. This reflects improvements in mapping technology but it is also due to changes in the sequence
            data to be mapped. The sequencing machines we are using now (e.g. Illumina Genome Analyzer II, HiSeq2000/2500,
            454 GS FLX etc) will not be the ones we are using in a few years time and the data the new machines produce
            are likely to be sub-optimally mapped with current tools.

    <h4>Extra Exercise: Identifying essential genes in a TraDIS analysis    </h4>
    <div class="alert alert-primary" role="alert">
        Mapping can be an initial step of a more complex bioinformatic pipeline, or can be a goal in itself if
        sequencing is being used to assess targeted regions of the genome or in conjunction with other molecular
        biology techniques. In this exercise we will analyze data from a run of the TraDIS (transposon directed
        insertion-site sequencing) technique (Langridge et al 2009, PMID:19826075). This experimental technique
        aims to uncover essential genes, genome-wide in an unbiased way. It relies on the use of a transposon to
        generate a large mutant pool with transposon insertions covering the whole genome. The large size of the
        transposon (>1Kb) will most likely disrupt the genomic region around its insertion site. Because we know
        the sequence of the transposon, performing whole genome sequencing allows us to identify all the transposon
        insertion sites within our library.<br><br>

        When essential genes are disrupted by the presence of the transposon, the affected bacteria will not grow.
        <strong>Therefore, genes with no detectable transposon insertions are likely essential</strong>. The exact likelihood of
        this observation is dependent on the initial mutant library size versus genome size, that is, the transposon
        coverage throughout the genome. The essentiality of the gene is dependent of the growth conditions of the
        mutants, allowing for the detection of condition specific gene essentiality.
    </div>
    <p>
        We will be using selected data from a recent TraDIS screen of Burkholderia pseudomallei (2 circular
        chromosomes, 6,332 predicted coding sequences within 7.25 Mb). B. pseudomallei is the causative agent
        of melioidosis, an often fatal infectious disease for which there is no vaccine. B. pseudomallei is
        listed as a Tier 1 select agent, and current therapeutic options are severely limited due to a natural
        resistance to many antibiotics. We will focus on reads from chromosome 1. The analysis goes through several
        steps, culminating with viewing the mapped regions using Tablet to assess the evidence that loci are
        essential:
    </p>
    <p>
        The transposon sequence is identifiable, but it is not part of the reference genome. Furthermore, not
        all sequenced reads will have the transposon in them. Prior to mapping the sequences should then be
        filtered and the transposon sequences removed.
    </p>
    <p>
        Change to the directory <strong>~/data/tradis</strong>. First let us consider at the raw fastq file
        in the <strong>~/data directory</strong>. How many reads are there?
    </p>
    <pre><code>zcat TraDIS_reads_chr1.fastq.gz | wc -l</code></pre>
    <div class="alert alert-warning" role="alert">
        Can you determine what the transposon sequence is?
    </div>
    <pre><code>zcat TraDIS_reads_chr1.fastq.gz | less</code></pre>
    <p>
        We are now going to run a Perl script to filter out the reads and create a new fastq file
        (TraDIS_reads_chr1.fq)
    </p>
    <pre><code>perl remove_transposon_and_filter_FASTQ.pl ~/data/tradis/TraDIS_reads_chr1.fastq.gz 0 > TraDIS_reads_chr1.fq </code></pre>
    <p>
        This script removes the transposon from the reads, as well as those reads that did not have the transposon
        signature sequence. The number of lines in the post QC file can be calculated by typing:
    </p>
    <pre><code>wc -l TraDIS_reads_chr1.fq</code></pre>

    <h6>Mapping reads using Bowtie to detect genomic insertion sites</h6>
    <p>
        The filtered <strong>TraDIS_reads_chr1.fq</strong> file of the previous step can now be mapped back to the
        reference genome (<strong>Bp.genome.fa</strong>). For this step we are going to use Bowtie (Langmead
        et al 2010, bowtie-bio.sf.net).
    </p>
    <p>
        Type <kbd>bowtie2</kbd> to see all the bowtie options, including those below:
    </p>
    <div class="alert alert-info" role="alert">
        <samp>-y (higher sensitivity)
-a (report all alignments found, instead of choosing just one randomly (bwa behaviour))
-v (number of allowed mismatches, 0 = perfect match between the read and the genome).
-S (produce output in SAM format)</samp>
    </div>
    <p>
        We need to produce a BAM file. Now we will perform the mapping, by typing:
    </p>
    <pre><code>bowtie-build Bp.genome.fa Bp.genome.fa
bowtie -y -a -v 0 -S Bp.genome.fa -q TraDIS_reads_chr1.fq 2> TraDIS_reads_chr1.bowtieLog.txt | samtools view -b - | samtools sort -o TraDIS_reads_chr1.bam -
samtools index TraDIS_reads_chr1.bam
</code></pre>
    <p>
        How many mismatches are we allowing? The file is in SAM format and needs to be indexed and converted
        to BAM using the following code.
    </p>

    <h4>Visualizing the results in Tablet</h4>
    <p>
        Tablet supports the input of indexed BAM files directly. As opposed to the previous examples, no insertions
        or deletions should be found in this dataset (single-end reads) and no mismatches/SNPs (because we are
        requiring perfect matches when mapping). Read in the following files into Tablet:
        <ul>
            <li>Bp.genome.fa (reference in ~/data/tradis/)</li>
            <li>Bp.genome.gff (annotation in ~/data/tradis/)</li>
            <li>TraDIS_reads_chr1.bam (sorted BAM in ~/data/tradis/)</li>
        </ul>

    </p>
    <img src="img/Mapping_28.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="Responsive image">
    <div class="alert alert-warning" role="alert">
        Use samtools flagstat (like the example below) with the indexed BAM file to see how many reads are mapping. Given that the size
        of chromosome 1 is 4074542 basepairs, what is the transposon insertion density? <br><br>
        <pre><code>samtools view -b TraDIS_reads_chr1.bam chr1:90207-90668 | samtools flagstat -</code></pre>
