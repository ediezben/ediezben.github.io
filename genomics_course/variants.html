      <h4>Variant Detection Practical</h4>
      <h4>Introduction</h4>
      <p>New sequencing technologies are mostly used for re-sequencing, namely when a well-assembled
        reference genome from the same organism or one very similar is available. Instead of assembling
        the reads to produce a new genome sequence, re-sequencing projects aim to compare the sampled
        genome with the reference by read mapping. Short read alignment was considered in the previous
        practical. Here, we will focus on downstream analyses aiming to identify Single Nucleotide
        Polymorphisms (SNPs), insertions and deletions (indels) and large structural variants (SVs)
        in the sequenced sample.</p>
      <p>Most of the software for variant detection and calling require alignment files (e.g. BAM
        format) as input. We will be using <i>samtools/bcftools</i> and GATK for SNP and small
        indel discovery.</p>
      <p>Historically, structural variation refers to relatively large polymorphisms that alter the
        chromosome structure. Indels belong to this group of genetic variation. Among the early
        methods for discovering structural variants (SVs), whole-genome array comparative hybridisation
        (Carter, 2007) and SNP arrays (Cooper, Zerr, Kidd, Eichler, & Nickerson, 2008) have been
        successfully applied despite their resolution limitations</p>
      <p>The advent of high-throughput sequencing platforms has opened new possibilities in this area.
        New tools have been developed to detect unusual patterns of reads, or pairs of reads, left by
        SVs. Such signatures can be broadly grouped into three categories of signature: discordant
        mapping of read pairs, read splitting, and depth of coverage. SV detection programs implement
        algorithms aiming to identify such signatures, or combinations of them, from sequence alignment
        files (Medvedev, Stanciu, & Brudno, 2009)</p>
      <p><b>SNP detection and calling</b></p>
      <p>Some differences between the reference and the mapped reads are due to sequencing errors. By
        definition, a quality score of 30 (Q30), refers to, on average, 1 in every 1000 bases in the
        reads is expected to be incorrect (Q20 1/100, Q40 1/10000 etc.). Nevertheless, the high depth
        of coverage achieved by current sequencing platforms SNPs can be distinguished from sequencing
        errors. True SNPs are expected to be shown as mismatches occurring consistently across multiple
        reads at the same reference position, whereas mismatches found at spurious locations are likely
        to be caused by sequencing errors (<b>Figure 1</b>). SNP calling tools make use of this fact to calculate
        statistical significance and filter out false positives</p>

        <h4>Exercise 1: Identifying Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs)</h4>
        <p>Open up a new session of Tablet:</p>
        <pre><code>tablet</pre></code>
        <p><b>Click under the “Home” tab in the Top Bar</b> <i>Open assembly</i>. Fill in all required fields including
          ‘Primary Assembly file’ and ‘Reference/Consensus file’. You can use the “<i>Browse…</i>” buttons to
          navigate and select the <i>~/data/tb/sample1.bam</i> and <i>~/data/tb/tb.fasta</i> files respectively
          (<b>Figure 2</b>).</p>

            </div>
          </div>
          <p>Once loaded do not forget to click on the contig to display the reads. You can load the annotation

            and the window in <b>Figure 3</b> will appear. If it does not appear ask for help from a demonstrator.</p>

            <h4>Exercise 2: Calling SNPs and short indels using SAM/BCFtools</h4>
            <p>In previous exercises raw reads were mapped onto the reference genome using BWA (Li & Durbin, 2010)
               for several Mtb samples, resulting in alignment files of BAM format. The combination of SAMtools
               (Li et al., 2009) and BCFtools (Danecek et al., 2011) is a widely established approach to call
               SNPs and small indels (Li, 2011). SAMtools gathers information from input BAM files and computes
               the likelihood of each possible genotype. BCFtools takes SAMtools output and performs the actual
               genotype calling. Results are stored in files of VCF format (Variant Call Format).</p>
            <p>We had an insight into the SNP detection in the previous practical, using a single c. Let us
              start by looking at again at <i>bcftools mpileup</i> command options that we will need to change to
              optimise SNP calling.</p>
            <p>Open up a new terminal window and type:</p>

          <p>The complete bcftools call command would be as follows (it will be run later):</p>
          <p><i>bcftools call –m –v –O v > sample1.raw.vcf</i></p>
          <p>or</p>
          <p><i>bcftools call –mvO v > sample1.raw.vcf</i></p>
          <p>Having understood <i>bcftools mpileup</i> and <i>bcftools call</i> parameters,
            we can combine both instructions to perform SNP and short indel calling as follows:</p>
          <pre><code>mkdir ~/data/tb/variants
cd ~/data/tb/variants/
bcftools mpileup -B -Q 23 -d 2000 -C 50 -f ~/data/tb/tb.fasta ~/data/tb/sample1.bam | bcftools call --ploidy 1 -mvO v - > sample1.raw.vcf
</pre></code>
          <p>As we saw in the Introduction to Linux Practical the character ‘|’ is used to ‘pipe’ <i>bcftools
             mpileup</i> output into <i>bcftools call</i> as input. We can further filter the resulting variant calls
             using the <i>vcfutils varFilter</i> command, which like <i>bcftools</i>, is installed as part of the
              <i>samtools</i> package. Parameters within this tool can be reviewed when executing:</p>
          <pre><code>vcfutils.pl varFilter</pre></code>
          <div class="alert alert-info" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">
<samp>Usage:   vcfutils.pl varFilter [options] <in.vcf>

Options: -Q INT    minimum RMS mapping quality for SNPs [10]
         -d INT    minimum read depth [2]
         -D INT    maximum read depth [10000000]
         -a INT    minimum number of alternate bases [2]
         -w INT    SNP within INT bp around a gap to be filtered [3]
         -W INT    window size for filtering adjacent gaps [10]
         -1 FLOAT  min P-value for strand bias (given PV4) [0.0001]
         -2 FLOAT  min P-value for baseQ bias [1e-100]

         -4 FLOAT  min P-value for end distance bias [0.0001]
         -e FLOAT  min P-value for HWE (plus F<0) [0.0001]
         -p        print filtered variants

Nb: Some of the filters rely on annotations generated by SAMtools/BCFtools.</samp></div>
        <p>The -D option of <i>varFilter</i> controls the maximum read depth, which should be adjusted at least to
          approximately twice the average read depth.  Finally, type the following commands to obtain a
          high quality set of variants in VCF format:</p>
        <pre><code>cat sample1.raw.vcf | vcfutils.pl varFilter -d 10 -D 2000 > sample1.filt.vcf</pre></code>
        <p>Run the code above for <i>sample2</i>. The bam has already been preprocessed so all you have to do
          is replace “<i>sample1</i>” in the command with “<i>sample2</i>”</p>
        <h4>Exercise 3: Calling SNPs and short indels using GATK</h4>
        <p>The Genome Analysis Toolkit (GATK) includes a wide variety of tools, with a primary focus on
          variant discovery and genotyping. The standard GATK data processing pipeline starts by applying
          the <i>HaplotypeCaller</i> to identify variable sites with respect to the reference.
          <i>HaplotypeCaller</i> will be set up by default to work on diploid organisms, therefore we will use
          the <i>--ploidy</i> 1 for bacterial genomes like <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i>.
            We will run GATK for SNPs and small indel calling to complement samtools/bcftools output.</p>
        <p>Run the following two commands to call SNPs and indels using GATK instead of Samtools:</p>
        <pre><code>cd ~/data/tb/variants/
gatk HaplotypeCaller -R ~/data/tb/tb.fasta -I ~/data/tb/sample1.bam -O sample1.gatk.raw.vcf -ploidy 1</pre></code>
        <p>Be sure to read the output to make sure that the <i>sample1.gatk.raw.vcf</i> file has been created correctly.</p>
        <h4>Exercise 4: Visualisation of variants (in VCF files) using Tablet</h4>
        <p>We can open the resulting VCF files within the terminal window with the <i>more</i>
           (or <i>less</i> or <i>head</i> or <i>cat</i>) command:</p>
        <pre><code>less sample1.filt.vcf</pre></code>
        <p>The output should look like:</p>

        <p><b>VCF format</b></p>
        <p>VCF (Variant Call Format) is a text file format employed to store genetic variation with
          respect to a reference genome. It contains meta-information lines (beginning with ##), a
          header line (starting with #) and then data lines each containing information about a
          variable position in the genome. All variants, including SNPs and indels, are defined
          by the chromosome (CHROM), position (base pairs) in the reference genome (POS), ID, reference
          allele (REF), alternative allele (ALT) and a quality score for the detected variant (QUAL).
          The FILTER field contains information about the filters applied, and INFO gathers additional
          information. A detailed description of VCF format specification can be found at:</p>
        <p><a href="http://samtools.github.io/hts-specs/VCFv4.3.pdf" target="_blank">http://samtools.github.io/hts-specs/VCFv4.3.pdf</a></p>
        <p>VCF files can be opened and visualised in genome browsers such as Artemis and Tablet
          but first need to be indexed.</p>
        <p>To index the resulting VCF files type the following lines of code:</p>
        <pre><code>cd ~/data/tb/variants/
bgzip sample1.filt.vcf
tabix -p vcf sample1.filt.vcf.gz
bgzip sample2.filt.vcf
tabix -p vcf sample2.filt.vcf.gz</pre></code>
        <p>Launch 2 Tablet instances and load sample1.bam and sample2.bam in each of them as
          explained in Exercise 1.</p>
        <p>In the tool bar, select Import features as if we were going to load an annotation
          file. But this time select the compressed VCF files in <i>~/data/tb/variants</i> (i.e.
          <i>sample1.filt.vcf.gz</i> for the instance with <i>sample1</i> loaded and <i>sample2.filt.vcf.gz</i>

        <p>Making use of <i>Jump to Navigator</i> visit the two regions we visited in Exercise 1
          (containing positions 187,503 and 587,585 respectively). Remember that we were
          trying to distinguish real SNPs from sequencing errors. Having loaded the VCF file,
          right click on the tracks below the nucleotide sequence to display the VCF track. Then
          the SNPs should appear in the VCF track above the reads panel (<b>Figure 5</b>). On the other
          hand, sequencing errors are not called SNPs at those positions.</p>

            <p><b>Drug resistance in <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i></b></p>
            <p>One area where polymorphisms are elevated in <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> is in genes relating to
              antibiotic action. Resistance to anti-tuberculosis drugs is caused predominantly by point mutations
              (i.e. SNPs) that arise spontaneously and offer the bacterium survival advantage during (incomplete)
              drug treatment. Since SNPs conferring drug resistance have been characterised (Sandgren et al.,
              2009) it has been proposed that drug susceptibility can be inferred based on the presence/absence
              of such markers (Peacock, 2013). In this exercise we will be looking at Rifampicin resistance-conferring
              mutations found in the <i>rpoB</i> gene.</p>

          <h4>Large structural variant (SV) detection and calling</h4>
          <p>While small indels can be detected by finding gaps within mapped reads, larger structural variation requires
            alternative approaches. When working with short reads and high depth of coverage,
            <i>samtools/bcftools</i> and GATK are established pipelines for detection and calling of SNPs
            and small indels. However, there are other algorithms and software for the identification of
            larger SVs (Medvedev et al., 2009). In the following exercises, we will introduce the main
            approaches and employ representative tools deploying such strategies. The software’s quality
            is measured in terms of sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of predicting breakpoint
            locations.</p>
          <p>Depth of coverage (DOC) methods assume that the number of mapped reads in a given region follow a
            (modified) Poisson distribution, and are expected to be proportional to the number of times such a
            region occurs in the sequenced genome. Deleted regions will have much fewer or no reads mapping to
            it, whereas a duplicated region will have more reads (Chiang, Getz, Jaffe, & O’Kelly, 2008;
            Sepulveda et al, 2013). The larger the event, the stronger the detected signal for these signatures.
             The main disadvantages of this approach are its inefficacy at detecting weaker signals caused
             by small events, breakpoint resolution and that gain signatures do not localise where the
             insertion occurred.</p>
          <h4>Exercise 5: SV detection using discordant paired-end mapping (PEM) and split read
            approaches (Delly software)</h4>
          <p>Mapping of paired-end reads (PEM) and DOC methods were the first to be implemented when reads
            were much shorter (~35bp). PEM is the most prominent method to detect large SVs (Medvedev et
            al., 2009). DOC signatures also support SVs including a copy number change in the sequenced
            genome, namely deletions and tandem duplications. Nevertheless, with longer (paired) reads
            achieved nowadays (up 150bp with Illumina HiSeq machines), read split methods outperform PEM
            software in terms of breakpoint resolution, higher discovery rates and lower false positives
            (Suzuki, Yasuda, & Shiraishi, 2011; Wang, Mullighan, Easton, & Roberts, 2011). Recently published
            tools, such as PRIMS (Jiang, Wang, & Brudno, 2012) and Delly (Rausch et al., 2012) make use of
            a complementary strategy under the assumption that SVs supported by different signatures are
            called with higher confidence. Both aforementioned tools use a split read approach assisted
            by the PEM. This exercise will combine paired-end and split-read alignment methods to increase
            sensitivity and specificity in SV calling. In particular we will be using Delly software to
            detect large structural variants.</p>
          <p>Change to variants directory and run the following commands:</p>
          <pre><code>cd ~/data/tb/variants/
delly call -o sample1.delly.bcf -q 20 -s 3 -g /home/user/data/tb/tb.fasta /home/user/data/tb/sample1.bam
delly call -o sample2.delly.bcf -q 20 -s 3 -g /home/user/data/tb/tb.fasta /home/user/data/tb/sample2.bam</pre></code>
          <p>It should take no longer than 5 minutes per file. Type the program name to display all options:</p>

Usage: delly <command> <arguments>

Commands:

    call         discover and genotype structural variants
    merge        merge structural variants across VCF/BCF files and within a single VCF/BCF file
    filter       filter somatic or germline structural variants</samp></div>
           <p>The software has two sequential steps. First, structural variants are predicted based on PEM
             signatures (<b>Figure 9</b>), in other words, when mapped pair insert size happens
             to be greater than expected.</p>
             <div class="text-center"><img src="img/variants_9.jpg" class="img-fluid"></div>

               </div>
             </div>
            <p>Paired-end options include, like all PEM-based software, the insert size cut-off
               (<i>-s</i>). The minimum paired-end mapping quality (<i>-q</i>) has been set to 20, therefore all
               reads with mapping quality below this threshold will be discarded. Structural variants detected
               by PEM will be outputted to the file indicated with ‘<i>-o</i>’.</p>
            The specification of the standard deviation units (<i>-s</i>) is probably the most important cut-off for
            PEM methods. A deletion is detected when the pair mapped distance exceeds the upper threshold
            defined as <i>s</i> times (<i>s</i> = 3) the standard deviation (&sigma;) over the mean (&mu; + 3&sigma;).
            <p>Second, Delly makes use of soft-clipped information to find exact breakpoints. <b>Read splitting
              approaches</b> rely on mapping broken reads that span breakpoints and are located in nearby locations.
              The structural variant signature in this case consists of one of the reads mapping to the reference and its
              split mate mapping with one of its parts approximately one insert size away. For insertions,
              the broken read will have its splits parts adjacent to each other, with a missing middle part
              of the read (<b>Figure 10</b>). In both cases, breakpoints can be resolved with base-pair precision.</p>

              <p><b>Confidently called events versus likely false positives</b></p>
              <p>SV detection tools output not only potential structural differences, but also
                a confidence value attach to them. An important threshold is the minimum number of supporting reads
                (found in Delly output) for an event to be retained. Hits with very few supporting reads (column 5)
                are expected to be false positives (FP). Repetitive and highly polymorphic regions in the genome are
                the main sources of such FP events.</p>

                <i><b>Notes</b></i>:
                <ul class="list-group">
                  <li class="list-group-item">A gap of coverage means no or few alignments cover a region
                    with respect to its neighbouring ones.</li>
                  <li class="list-group-item">If you change to Packed reads (Paired) the read pairs having greater
                    insert sizes than expected will be displaying a dashed line linking them that will span a big
                    distance. Insert size values are also shown in the read information box when placing the mouse
                    over the reads.</li>
                  <li class="list-group-item">Tablet does not colour split-reads differently. Nevertheless, the
                    Cigar field in the read information box (shown when placing the cursor over the read) informs
                     about how many bases in the read are mapped and soft-clipped. For instance, a Cigar field like
                     ‘75M’ means all positions in a 75 bp read have been mapped to the reference. A string like
                     ‘12S63M’ means the first 12-bp region of the read was soft-clipped, namely aligned somewhere
                     else, while the remaining 63 bp were mapped. Make use of the Cigar information to identify
                     soft-clipped reads</li>

                  few supporting reads (column 5).</p>
